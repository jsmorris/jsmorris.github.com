I just added "Google Analytics":http://www.google.com/analytics/ to "jsmorris.github.com":http://jsmorris.github.com.

I am using this as a learning experience to find out what "Google Analytics":http://www.google.com/analytics/ can do for a website.

It was very simple to create your account, add the two blocks of javascript to each page on your website, and verify that it was pulling data.

I will not have much traffic here until I reach one of my goals for 2009 which will be to create a community or at least a small following of users who will visit my site and read my blog.
